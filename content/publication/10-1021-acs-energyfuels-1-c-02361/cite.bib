 abstract = { 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) is considered an attractive solvent for CO2 capture, but the mechanism responsible for its thermal degradation to the major product, cyclic 4,4-dimethyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one (DMOZD), is still uncertain. Oxazolidinone formation is known to occur via carbamate formation as seen from the case of aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) in which cyclic 2-oxazolidinone (OZD) may further react with free MEA leading to the formation of more stable products. However, bicarbonate has been experimentally found to be the predominant species in the CO2-loaded aqueous AMP solution, contrary to the case of MEA. Based on first-principles simulations, we present molecular mechanisms underlying the anomalous degradation of AMP in the CO2 capture process. Our simulation results clearly suggest a high likelihood of carbamic acid formation in high CO2 loaded, concentrated aqueous solutions of AMP, especially at high stripping temperatures (>400 K) where bicarbonate formation tends to be kinetically less favorable than carbamate formation. DMOZD is found to be formed from carbamic acid primarily following a direct ring-closure mechanism. Our simulations also demonstrate that the reaction of DMOZD with free AMP can be markedly suppressed compared to the reaction between OZD and free MEA. Further analyses clearly illustrate that the presence of methyl groups in AMP and AMP derivatives makes their solvation structure and dynamics noticeably different from those of MEA and MEA derivatives. The solvation effect turns out to be largely responsible for the distinct difference in the degradation behavior between AMP and MEA in aqueous solution. Our findings can provide guidance for rational ligand design of sterically hindered amines for cost-effective CO2 capture.},
