abstract: Protonic ceramic fuel cells can be operated at low temperatures, but their
  performances relying on bulk ion transfer in solid electrolytes are usually limited
  by much lower proton conductivity than 0.1 S/cm below 600 °C. Herein, however, we
  report a strategy for Al2O3 insulator to become a protonic superconductor, namely,
  in-situ generation of superstructured-water in porous Al2O3 layer could realize
  the unprecedented water-mediated proton transfer on Al2O3 surface, attaining ultrahigh
  proton conductivity of 0.13 S/cm at 550 °C. With such a water-superstructured proton-superconductor,
  we created water-superstructured solid fuel cell, achieving very high power density
  of 1036 mW/cm2 and high open circuit voltage above 1.1 V at 550 °C with H2 fuel.
  This provides a general approach to develop protonic superconductors and solid fuel
  cells.
