abstract: To reduce the regeneration energy consumption for CO2 capture, an advanced
  monoethanolamine (MEA) + 2-(ethylamino)ethanol (EAE) + sulfolane biphasic aqueous
  solution was developed, and the phase separation mechanism was explored. The effects
  of the concentration ratio on the phase separation behavior, CO2 absorption performance,
  CO2 loading at the phase separation point, and CO2 desorption performance of MEA + EAE + sulfolane
  solutions were investigated comprehensively in experiments. The 3 M MEA + 2 M EAE + 5 M
  sulfolane showed the best properties with a large CO2 loading of 0.32 mol/mol at
  the phase separation point and the relative low regeneration energy consumption,
  which is comparable to 5 M MEA in absorption with an improved desorption performance.
  The molecular mechanism of phase separation was revealed by molecular dynamics simulations,
  illustrating that strong hydrogen bonding between amine products and water and enhanced
  intermolecular interaction among amine products, would promote an aggregation of
  amine products. This study provides a promising candidate for energy-efficient CO2
  capture with molecular insights into a liquid–liquid phase separation.
