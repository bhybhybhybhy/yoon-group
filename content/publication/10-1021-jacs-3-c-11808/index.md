abstract: ' Amino acid ionic liquids (AAILs) are promising green materials for CO2
  capture and conversion due to their large chemical structural tunability. However,
  the structural understanding of the AAILs underlying the CO2 reaction dynamics remains
  uncertain. Herein, we examine the steric effects of AAIL anions with various chemical
  structures on CO2 capture behavior. Based on ab initio free-energy sampling, we
  assess reaction mechanisms for carbamate formation via a two-step reaction pathway
  with a zwitterion intermediate undergoing dynamic proton transfer. Our results show
  that free-energy barriers for carbamate formation can be significantly reduced as
  the degree of steric hindrance of the anions decreases. Further analyses reveal
  that reduced steric hindrance of anions causes markedly stronger intermolecular
  interactions between zwitterion and anions, leading to an increased kinetically
  favorable intermolecular proton transfer for carbamate production. We also describe
  the correlation strength between intramolecular interactions within the zwitterion
  and intermolecular interactions between the zwitterion and anions. We conclude that
  the favored structural flexibility due to the less steric hindrance of the zwitterion
  leads to enhanced intermolecular interactions, facilitating proton transfer to nearby
  AAIL anions for carbamate formation. Our study provides invaluable insight into
  the influence of various degrees of steric hindrance of the AAIL anions governing
  CO2 chemisorption. These findings may aid in the design of optimal AAIL solvents
  for the CO2 capture process. '
