abstract: To explore the regulatory factor of phase separation and the effect of solvent
  structure, the phase separation behavior, absorption/desorption performance, viscosity
  change, heat duty and ternary phase diagram of 3 monoethanolamine(MEA)-based phasic
  absorbents using 3 alcohols with various carbon chain lengths and isomers were determined
  by comprehensive experiments. The tunable phase separation behavior of MEA-based
  biphasic absorbents can be achieved by adjusting the mass concentration ratio of
  solvent and water, and the CO2 loading of phase separation point was much more impacted
  by the effect of the carbon chain length than that of isomerism. The intermolecular
  interactions between species in solutions before and after CO2 absorption were analyzed
  by the classical molecular dynamics simulations and independent gradient model analysis.
  Based on the experimental and computational results, the fundamental mechanism of
  phase separation was elucidated, which is related to the broken of hydrogen bonds
  between solvent with H2O or MEA, and the enhanced interaction among MEACOOâˆ’, MEAH+
  and H2O. This study highlights the effect of structure effect on developing advanced
  CO2 biphasic absorbents, which may reduce the energy consumption of regeneration
  significantly.
