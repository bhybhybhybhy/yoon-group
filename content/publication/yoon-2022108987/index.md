abstract: Carbon dioxide (CO2) absorption into aqueous amine solvents is known to
  be governed by two competing reactions leading to carbamate or bicarbonate formation.
  Sterically hindered alkanolamines with different degrees of methylation are experimentally
  known to cause different favorability in forming carbamate or bicarbonate. However,
  the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the preferential formation of carbamate
  or bicarbonate still remain unclear. Herein, we present CO2 absorption behavior
  with several different sterically hindered amines, especially the effects of methylation
  and temperature. Our ab initio metadynamics simulations clearly demonstrate that
  free-energy barriers for the carbamate and bicarbonate formation reactions strongly
  depend on the degree of steric hindrance of hydrophobic methyl groups. This in turn
  directly impacts on the kinetic favorability of the two competing reaction pathways.
  Our analysis shows that various degrees of steric effects cause considerably different
  temperature-dependent degrees of solvation of the nitrogen atom of hindered amines,
  which may directly affect CO2 accessibility to form carbamate. Moreover, the enhanced
  solvation as a result of increased steric effects particularly at low absorption
  temperatures lead to kinetically facile protonation of the nitrogen atom of amines,
  initiating and promoting bicarbonate formation. Our work sheds light on the effects
  of various degrees of steric hindrance, with different temperature-dependent solvation
  degrees governing reaction mechanisms and rates during CO2 capture.
