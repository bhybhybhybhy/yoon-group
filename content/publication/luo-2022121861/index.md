abstract: An energy-efficient monoethanolamine (MEA)/ n-butanol biphasic solution
  with tunable phase separation was proposed in this study. The effect of the solvation
  environment and the mechanism of the liquid–liquid phase separation were investigated
  systematically by both experimental study and molecular dynamics simulations. Experimental
  results showed that the concentration ratio of n-butanol and water played a significant
  role in the phase separation behavior and desorption performance, and can effectively
  reduce the heat duty of desorption. The mechanism of phase separation was obtained
  using 1H NMR and molecular dynamics simulation, which was related to the strong
  strength of hydrogen bonds between MEAH+ and H2O, MEACOO− and H2O, and the van der
  Waals forces between MEAH+ and MEACOO−. In addition, the effect of the solvation
  environment on the phase separation was also attributed to the strong intermolecular
  interaction between MEAH+ and MEACOO−. This study highlights the effect of the solvation
  environment on the tunable phase separation and the mechanism of phase separation
  for the further development of biphasic solutions.
