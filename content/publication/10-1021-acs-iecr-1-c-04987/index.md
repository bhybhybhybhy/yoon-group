abstract: ' Monoethanolamine (MEA) is the most studied and used to be considered as
  benchmark solvent for CO2 capture. CO2 absorption in aqueous MEA is well known to
  produce ion pairs such as carbamate (MEACOO–) and protonated amine (MEAH+), following
  a stepwise reaction mechanism involving a zwitterionic intermediate (MEA+COO–).
  Contrastingly, thermal degradation of MEA has been thought to occur through carbamic
  acid (MEACOOH) formation under stripper conditions. This raises a fundamental question
  regarding the MEACOOH formation mechanism and its relative concentration in CO2-loaded
  aqueous MEA. Using ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations, we
  have determined probable routes and free-energy barriers for proton transfer reactions
  associated with the MEA+COO– ↔ MEACOO–/MEAH+ conversion. Our results clearly demonstrate
  that the lowest free-energy path involves MEACOOH formation in a 30 wt % MEA solution.
  A zero-dimensional model based on the predicted energetics illustrates that the
  concentration ratio of MEACOOH to MEACOO– increases with CO2 loading and temperature;
  the estimated ratio reaches up to 25% at high CO2 loadings (∼0.5) and high stripping
  temperatures (∼413 K). While carbamic acid formation tends to be a function of amine
  type, the quantitative understanding helps explain experimental observations and
  also greatly assists in designing amine-based solvents that have enhanced resistance
  to thermal degradation. '
