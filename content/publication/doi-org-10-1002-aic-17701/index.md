abstract: Abstract The reaction kinetics and molecular mechanisms of CO2 absorption
  using nonaqueous and aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA)/methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)/2-amino-2-methy-1-propanol
  (AMP) solutions were analyzed by the stopped-flow technique and ab initio molecular
  dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Pseudo first-order rate constants (k0) of reactions
  between CO2 and amines were measured. A kinetic model was proposed to correlate
  the k0 to the amine concentration, and was proved to perform well for predicting
  the relationship between k0 and the amine concentration. The experimental results
  showed that AMP/MDEA only took part in the deprotonation of MEA-zwitterion in nonaqueous
  MEA + AMP/MEA + MDEA solutions. In aqueous solutions, AMP can also react with CO2
  through base-catalyzed hydration mechanism beside the zwitterion mechanism. Molecular
  mechanisms of CO2 absorption were also explored by AIMD simulations coupled with
  metadynamics sampling. The predicted free-energy barriers of key elementary reactions
  verified the kinetic model and demonstrated the different molecular mechanisms for
  the reaction between CO2 and AMP.
