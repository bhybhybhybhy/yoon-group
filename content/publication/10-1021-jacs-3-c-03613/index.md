abstract: ' Amino acid ionic liquids have received increasing attention as ideal candidates
  for the CO2 chemisorption process. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms,
  especially those involving proton transfer, remain unclear. In this work, we elucidate
  the atomistic-level reaction mechanisms responsible for carbamate formation during
  CO2 capture by amino acid ionic liquids through explicit ab initio molecular dynamics
  augmented by well-tempered metadynamics. The resulting ab initio free-energy sampling
  reveals a two-step reaction pathway in which a zwitterion, initially formed from
  the reaction between the anion of serine and CO2, undergoes a kinetically facile
  intermolecular proton transfer to the O atom of the COOâ€“ moiety in the nearby serine.
  Further analysis reveals that the significantly reduced free-energy barriers are
  attributed to enhanced intermolecular interaction between the zwitterion and serine,
  thus facilitating the kinetic favorability of the proton transfer, which governs
  the overall CO2 capture mechanism. This work provides valuable insight into the
  important mechanistic and kinetic features of these reactions from explicit condensed
  phase ab initio MD free-energy sampling of the CO2 capture process. '
