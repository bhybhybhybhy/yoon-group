abstract: This study attempts to explain the well-known experimental observation that
  1,3-bis(2-aminoethyl)urea (urea) is preferentially formed over the other major product,
  2-imidazolidone (IZD), from thermal degradation of aqueous ethylenediamine (EDA)
  during the CO2 capture process. This is in direct contrast to the case of monoethanolamine
  (MEA), preferentially forming oxazolidinone (OZD), rather than urea, which undergoes
  further reactions leading to more stable products. Given their similar molecular
  structures, the different preferred degradation pathways of EDA and MEA impose an
  intriguing question regarding the underlying mechanism responsible for the distinct
  difference. Thermal degradation of both EDA and MEA tends to proceed mainly via
  formation of an isocyanate intermediate that may further undergo either cyclization
  to IZD (or OZD) or a reaction with EDA (or MEA) forming urea. For the EDA case,
  our first-principles simulations clearly demonstrate that the urea formation reaction
  is kinetically more, but thermodynamically less, favorable than the cyclization
  reaction; the opposite is true for the MEA case. Our further analysis shows that
  EDA–isocyanate is less prone to cyclization than MEA–isocyanate, which in turn allows
  for more facile urea formation. The reconfiguration dynamics of isocyanate is found
  to be governed by the dynamic nature of the interaction between its terminal group
  and surrounding solvent molecules. Our work highlights the importance of kinetic
  effects associated with the local structure and dynamics of solvent molecules around
  the intermediates that may significantly alter the degradation process of amine
  solvents.
