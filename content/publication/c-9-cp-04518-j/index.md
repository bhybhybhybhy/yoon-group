abstract: Thermal degradation of aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA), a benchmark solvent,
  in CO2 capture processes still remains a challenge. Here, we present molecular mechanisms
  underlying thermal degradation of MEA based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations
  coupled with metadynamics sampling. Isocyanate formation via dehydration of carbamic
  acid (MEACOOH) is predicted to be highly probable and more kinetically favorable
  than the competing cyclizationâ€“dehydration reaction to 2-oxazolidinone (OZD), albeit
  not substantially. Isocyanate may undergo cyclization to form OZD, which is found
  to be more facile in aqueous MEA solution than reaction with MEA to form urea, although
  the latter is thermodynamically more favorable than the former. Our simulations
  also clearly demonstrate that OZD is a long-lived intermediate that plays a key
  role in MEA thermal degradation to experimentally observed products. Overall, this
  work highlights the importance of entropic contributions associated with the local
  structure and dynamics of solvent molecules around the intermediates, which cannot
  be solely explained by thermodynamics, in predicting the mechanism and kinetics
  of thermal degradation of CO2-loaded aqueous amine solutions.
