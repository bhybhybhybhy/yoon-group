abstract  ="Thermal degradation of aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA){,} a benchmark solvent{,} in CO2 capture processes still remains a challenge. Here{,} we present molecular mechanisms underlying thermal degradation of MEA based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations coupled with metadynamics sampling. Isocyanate formation via dehydration of carbamic acid (MEACOOH) is predicted to be highly probable and more kinetically favorable than the competing cyclization–dehydration reaction to 2-oxazolidinone (OZD){,} albeit not substantially. Isocyanate may undergo cyclization to form OZD{,} which is found to be more facile in aqueous MEA solution than reaction with MEA to form urea{,} although the latter is thermodynamically more favorable than the former. Our simulations also clearly demonstrate that OZD is a long-lived intermediate that plays a key role in MEA thermal degradation to experimentally observed products. Overall{,} this work highlights the importance of entropic contributions associated with the local structure and dynamics of solvent molecules around the intermediates{,} which cannot be solely explained by thermodynamics{,} in predicting the mechanism and kinetics of thermal degradation of CO2-loaded aqueous amine solutions."}

abstract  ="This study attempts to explain the well-known experimental observation that 1{,}3-bis(2-aminoethyl)urea (urea) is preferentially formed over the other major product{,} 2-imidazolidone (IZD){,} from thermal degradation of aqueous ethylenediamine (EDA) during the CO2 capture process. This is in direct contrast to the case of monoethanolamine (MEA){,} preferentially forming oxazolidinone (OZD){,} rather than urea{,} which undergoes further reactions leading to more stable products. Given their similar molecular structures{,} the different preferred degradation pathways of EDA and MEA impose an intriguing question regarding the underlying mechanism responsible for the distinct difference. Thermal degradation of both EDA and MEA tends to proceed mainly via formation of an isocyanate intermediate that may further undergo either cyclization to IZD (or OZD) or a reaction with EDA (or MEA) forming urea. For the EDA case{,} our first-principles simulations clearly demonstrate that the urea formation reaction is kinetically more{,} but thermodynamically less{,} favorable than the cyclization reaction; the opposite is true for the MEA case. Our further analysis shows that EDA–isocyanate is less prone to cyclization than MEA–isocyanate{,} which in turn allows for more facile urea formation. The reconfiguration dynamics of isocyanate is found to be governed by the dynamic nature of the interaction between its terminal group and surrounding solvent molecules. Our work highlights the importance of kinetic effects associated with the local structure and dynamics of solvent molecules around the intermediates that may significantly alter the degradation process of amine solvents."}

This finding offers explanation for the intriguing observation of oxazolidinone formation as the major product of AMP degradation, which is known to occur via carbamate, as also seen from thermal degradation of aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) in CO2 capture processes. From ab initio molecular dynamics simulations coupled with metadynamics sampling, the free-energy barrier for carbamate formation is predicted to substantially decrease from 11.7 to 5.5 kcal/mol with increasing temperature from 313 to 413 K in 25 wt \% AMP solution whereas that for bicarbonate formation increases from 9.6 to 12.4 kcal/mol. Likewise, the predicted free-energy barrier for carbamate formation in aqueous MEA also decreases with temperature but is significantly less compared to the AMP case. Further analysis demonstrates that the increase of temperature results in enhancing the disruption of the hydrogen bond network around the basic nitrogen atom of AMP (or MEA), allowing more facile CO2 access to form carbamate. Our work provides new insight on the strong temperature dependence of the CO2 capture mechanism and kinetics in aqueous solutions of amines, arising from changes in the hydrogen bond structure and dynamics around amines.}

abstract = { 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) is considered an attractive solvent for CO2 capture, but the mechanism responsible for its thermal degradation to the major product, cyclic 4,4-dimethyl-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one (DMOZD), is still uncertain. Oxazolidinone formation is known to occur via carbamate formation as seen from the case of aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) in which cyclic 2-oxazolidinone (OZD) may further react with free MEA leading to the formation of more stable products. However, bicarbonate has been experimentally found to be the predominant species in the CO2-loaded aqueous AMP solution, contrary to the case of MEA. Based on first-principles simulations, we present molecular mechanisms underlying the anomalous degradation of AMP in the CO2 capture process. Our simulation results clearly suggest a high likelihood of carbamic acid formation in high CO2 loaded, concentrated aqueous solutions of AMP, especially at high stripping temperatures (>400 K) where bicarbonate formation tends to be kinetically less favorable than carbamate formation. DMOZD is found to be formed from carbamic acid primarily following a direct ring-closure mechanism. Our simulations also demonstrate that the reaction of DMOZD with free AMP can be markedly suppressed compared to the reaction between OZD and free MEA. Further analyses clearly illustrate that the presence of methyl groups in AMP and AMP derivatives makes their solvation structure and dynamics noticeably different from those of MEA and MEA derivatives. The solvation effect turns out to be largely responsible for the distinct difference in the degradation behavior between AMP and MEA in aqueous solution. Our findings can provide guidance for rational ligand design of sterically hindered amines for cost-effective CO2 capture.}

abstract = { Monoethanolamine (MEA) is the most studied and used to be considered as benchmark solvent for CO2 capture. CO2 absorption in aqueous MEA is well known to produce ion pairs such as carbamate (MEACOO–) and protonated amine (MEAH+), following a stepwise reaction mechanism involving a zwitterionic intermediate (MEA+COO–). Contrastingly, thermal degradation of MEA has been thought to occur through carbamic acid (MEACOOH) formation under stripper conditions. This raises a fundamental question regarding the MEACOOH formation mechanism and its relative concentration in CO2-loaded aqueous MEA. Using ab initio molecular dynamics and metadynamics simulations, we have determined probable routes and free-energy barriers for proton transfer reactions associated with the MEA+COO– ↔ MEACOO–/MEAH+ conversion. Our results clearly demonstrate that the lowest free-energy path involves MEACOOH formation in a 30 wt \% MEA solution. A zero-dimensional model based on the predicted energetics illustrates that the concentration ratio of MEACOOH to MEACOO– increases with CO2 loading and temperature; the estimated ratio reaches up to 25\% at high CO2 loadings (∼0.5) and high stripping temperatures (∼413 K). While carbamic acid formation tends to be a function of amine type, the quantitative understanding helps explain experimental observations and also greatly assists in designing amine-based solvents that have enhanced resistance to thermal degradation. }

Pseudo first-order rate constants (k0) of reactions between CO2 and amines were measured. A kinetic model was proposed to correlate the k0 to the amine concentration, and was proved to perform well for predicting the relationship between k0 and the amine concentration. The experimental results showed that AMP/MDEA only took part in the deprotonation of MEA-zwitterion in nonaqueous MEA + AMP/MEA + MDEA solutions. In aqueous solutions, AMP can also react with CO2 through base-catalyzed hydration mechanism beside the zwitterion mechanism. Molecular mechanisms of CO2 absorption were also explored by AIMD simulations coupled with metadynamics sampling. The predicted free-energy barriers of key elementary reactions verified the kinetic model and demonstrated the different molecular mechanisms for the reaction between CO2 and AMP.},

This raises a question on factors affecting the rates of key reactions involved in PZ thermal degradation. Herein, we present the underlying mechanisms of PZ degradation and the relative rates of key steps involved based on ab initio metadynamics simulations. We have identified the reaction between PZ and protonated PZ resulting in an intermediate, 1-[2-(2-aminoethyl)amino]ethyl] piperazine (AEAEPZH+), and the subsequent reaction of AEAEPZH+ with PZ leading to AEP or PEP/EDA. Our simulations demonstrate that the free-energy barriers for these intermolecular reactions are largely determined by the local solvation structure and dynamics of the amine species involved. We also discuss the strong effects of temperature and molecular structure on the solvation environments. While offering an explanation for preferred AEP formation in 30 wt \% PZ, our work sheds light on the possibility that both the mechanism and rate of the PZ degradation reaction can be altered with changes in temperature and amine concentration. }

Experimental results showed that the concentration ratio of n-butanol and water played a significant role in the phase separation behavior and desorption performance, and can effectively reduce the heat duty of desorption. The mechanism of phase separation was obtained using 1H NMR and molecular dynamics simulation, which was related to the strong strength of hydrogen bonds between MEAH+ and H2O, MEACOO− and H2O, and the van der Waals forces between MEAH+ and MEACOO−. In addition, the effect of the solvation environment on the phase separation was also attributed to the strong intermolecular interaction between MEAH+ and MEACOO−.

Sterically hindered alkanolamines with different degrees of methylation are experimentally known to cause different favorability in forming carbamate or bicarbonate. However, the fundamental mechanisms responsible for the preferential formation of carbamate or bicarbonate still remain unclear. Herein, we present CO2 absorption behavior with several different sterically hindered amines, especially the effects of methylation and temperature. Our ab initio metadynamics simulations clearly demonstrate that free-energy barriers for the carbamate and bicarbonate formation reactions strongly depend on the degree of steric hindrance of hydrophobic methyl groups. This in turn directly impacts on the kinetic favorability of the two competing reaction pathways. Our analysis shows that various degrees of steric effects cause considerably different temperature-dependent degrees of solvation of the nitrogen atom of hindered amines, which may directly affect CO2 accessibility to form carbamate. Moreover, the enhanced solvation as a result of increased steric effects particularly at low absorption temperatures lead to kinetically facile protonation of the nitrogen atom of amines, initiating and promoting bicarbonate formation. Our work sheds light on the effects of various degrees of steric hindrance, with different temperature-dependent solvation degrees governing reaction mechanisms and rates during CO2 capture.}

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms, especially those involving proton transfer, remain unclear. In this work, we elucidate the atomistic-level reaction mechanisms responsible for carbamate formation during CO2 capture by amino acid ionic liquids through explicit ab initio molecular dynamics augmented by well-tempered metadynamics. The resulting ab initio free-energy sampling reveals a two-step reaction pathway in which a zwitterion, initially formed from the reaction between the anion of serine and CO2, undergoes a kinetically facile intermolecular proton transfer to the O atom of the COO– moiety in the nearby serine. Further analysis reveals that the significantly reduced free-energy barriers are attributed to enhanced intermolecular interaction between the zwitterion and serine, thus facilitating the kinetic favorability of the proton transfer, which governs the overall CO2 capture mechanism. This work provides valuable insight into the important mechanistic and kinetic features of these reactions from explicit condensed phase ab initio MD free-energy sampling of the CO2 capture process. }

However, the structural understanding of the AAILs underlying the CO2 reaction dynamics remains uncertain. Herein, we examine the steric effects of AAIL anions with various chemical structures on CO2 capture behavior. Based on ab initio free-energy sampling, we assess reaction mechanisms for carbamate formation via a two-step reaction pathway with a zwitterion intermediate undergoing dynamic proton transfer. Our results show that free-energy barriers for carbamate formation can be significantly reduced as the degree of steric hindrance of the anions decreases. Further analyses reveal that reduced steric hindrance of anions causes markedly stronger intermolecular interactions between zwitterion and anions, leading to an increased kinetically favorable intermolecular proton transfer for carbamate production. We also describe the correlation strength between intramolecular interactions within the zwitterion and intermolecular interactions between the zwitterion and anions. We conclude that the favored structural flexibility due to the less steric hindrance of the zwitterion leads to enhanced intermolecular interactions, facilitating proton transfer to nearby AAIL anions for carbamate formation. Our study provides invaluable insight into the influence of various degrees of steric hindrance of the AAIL anions governing CO2 chemisorption. These findings may aid in the design of optimal AAIL solvents for the CO2 capture process. }
